# Image-Classification-with-NN-vs-CNN
This deep learning project explores the effectiveness of a dense neural network versus a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, architecture design, training history, evaluation metrics, and prediction visualizations. Built with TensorFlow/Keras in Python.
